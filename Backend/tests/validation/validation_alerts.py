Validation and Alert System for SmartWatt Energy Management Platform

This module provides intelligent validation for appliance usage patterns with:
1. Seasonal/contextual validation (e.g., AC usage in monsoon)
2. Appliance overuse detection (e.g., iron >1.25 hours/day)
3. Aggregate pattern diagnosis (e.g., single appliance dominance)

Each validation returns (severity, message) tuple or None.
Severity levels: 'info', 'warning', 'error'
