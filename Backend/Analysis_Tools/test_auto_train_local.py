"""
Auto-Train Pipeline for SmartWatt  (The "Self-Improving" System)
------------------------------------------------------------------
This script is the "Gym" for our AI.
Every time we run this, the AI gets smarter.

Workflow:
1. GENERATE: Create a new "Virtual World" of Kerala households (Physics-based Ground Truth).
2. TRAIN: Teach the AI models using this fresh data.
3. DEPLOY: Save the brain files (.keras) so the backend can use them.

Why? 
Because static AI gets stale. We want an AI that can learn from new physics rules instantly.
